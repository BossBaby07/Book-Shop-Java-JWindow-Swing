# Book-Shop-Java-JWindow-Swing

Read carefully.. 

In side the "Book-Shop-Java-JWindow-Swing" folder you will get "Book Shop Java App" folder.. actually this is your customer database folder. "customerDatabase.txt" file is your main data.
just copy the folder and paste it in side the (E:\) drive of your desktop/laptop.. 

Thanks!!
